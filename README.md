:large_orange_diamond: Traditional paper certificates and electronic certificates are time-consuming, difficult to manage and maintain, may require third parties to authenticate the certificate, and have a chance of being altered. So, in order to prevent these problems, we created a project that would allow us to verify certificates using blockchain technology.

:large_orange_diamond: The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) will store the college certificate after the university enters the student's roll number and uploads it. A hash that uniquely identifies that block is created and saved on IPFS and blockchain. The college certificate can now be retrieved and verified by anyone by supplying a special hash value and the student's roll number, such as a student, recruiter, or administrator. In the event that the produced hash value is forgotten, the certificate can also be validated by supplying the certificate and the student's roll number. Increased security, lower expenses, and a quicker platform for confirming educational credentials can all be obtained as a result.
